The fundamental technology applied broadly allows users to invite a specific set of people near a specific place at a certain time. Then track invitees location while enroute.

The applicaion changes norms by allowing people to send invites on-demand. Invites can potentially be to strangers near-by

The first specific application will be for Realtors.

To create an account is as simple as downloading the app and adding a name.

GPS enabled mobile technology allows people to be summoned spontaneously to places they are near when an invitee sends out an invite.

Invite friends to the app so you can invite them anytime you want.

When you go to the invite screen you have a friends list that is ordered by frequent invites up top (like a top 10 list) then below is the same set of friends ordered by proximity to you or your place of interest.
